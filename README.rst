===================
Package Boilerplate
===================

Python package boilerplate for package that fit in a single file (optimized for me).

Comes with a modified version of `kr-sphinx-themes <https://github.com/kennethreitz/kr-sphinx-themes>`_ for sphinx docs (font updated with `Open Sans <http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans>`_ and `Incosolota <http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Inconsolata>`_ for code, from Google Fonts).

 

Getting Started
===============

* Replace **packagename** in .gitignore
* Update setup.py
* Start coding
* Update docs/conf.py and start writing docs
